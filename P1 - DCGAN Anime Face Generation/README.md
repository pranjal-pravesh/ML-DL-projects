The goal of this project is to generate anime faces using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) implemented with Keras and TensorFlow in a Kaggle Notebook. This advanced deep learning project involves training two models: a generator and a discriminator. The discriminator is responsible for distinguishing between real and generated images, while the generator aims to create realistic images that can deceive the discriminator. As training progresses, the generator improves its ability to produce diverse and high-quality anime faces resembling the training dataset.
